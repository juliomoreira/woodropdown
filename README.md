# Woodropdown

Woodropdown is a simple CSS/jQuery plugin to customize <select> HTML tags.


## How it works

It does not customize the <select> tag itself, it does fake the element and its UI interactions by creating a anchor <a> tag for triggering
the interactions an a <ul> element and <li><a> as a <option> replacement.

## How to use it

Well, if you are not sure how to implement it, i suggest you to search for a similar project as it is still in the early days of development.

I do not own a single line of code here, feel free to use it where you want. It's using jQuery and HTML5 Boilerplate (and its helpers) so
the credit goes all to them.
